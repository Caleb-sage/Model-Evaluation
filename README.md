# Model-Evaluation

**Project Description: Evaluation Interpretability Scenario**

**Project Overview:**
The "Evaluation Interpretability Scenario" project delves into the evaluation and interpretability of machine learning models. Through the utilization of Jupyter Notebook, the project offers an interactive platform for exploring model evaluation techniques and interpreting their results.

**Objective:**
The primary objective of this project is to provide insights into the evaluation and interpretability of machine learning models. By examining a specific scenario, the project aims to showcase various evaluation metrics, visualization techniques, and model interpretability methods.

**Key Features:**
- **Data Exploration:** Exploration of the dataset relevant to the evaluation scenario to understand its characteristics and complexities.
- **Model Evaluation:** Implementation of evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
- **Interpretability Techniques:** Utilization of interpretability techniques such as feature importance analysis, SHAP values, and decision boundary visualization.
- **Interactive Analysis:** Leveraging Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis, code execution, and visualization of evaluation results.

**Project Structure:**
- **Evaluation Interpretability Scenario Completed-checkpoint.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the complete project code, including data exploration, model evaluation, and interpretability analysis.
- **README.md:** Project README file providing an overview of the project, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.
